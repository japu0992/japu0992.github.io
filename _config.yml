  As an undergrad I attended the University of Colorado Boulder and pursued a Bachelors Degree in Business Managment with an emphasis in Operations and Information management. 
  I was motivated to continue my education in data analytics back at CU pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics, with an emphasis in Security Analytics.

  This is a portfolio of some of the projects I did to achieve my Masters Degree.
