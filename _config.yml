  As an undergrad I attended the University of Colorado Boulder and pursued a Bachelors Degree in Business Managment with an emphasis in Operations and Information management. 
  I was motivated to continue my education in data analytics back at CU pursuing a Master's degree in Business Analytics, with an emphasis in Security Analytics. 
  I am experienced in analytical platforms learned through my coursework including Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel. 
  I am fascinated by the implementation of data analytics in operation decision-making and how companies are adapting to the exponential growth of data.

  This is a portfolio of some of the projects I did to achieve my Masters Degree.
